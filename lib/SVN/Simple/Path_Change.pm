    use SVN::Simple::Path_Change;
    use SVN::Core;
    use SVN::Fs;
    use SVN::Repos;

    my $repos = SVN::Repos::open('/path/to/svn/repos');
    my $fs = $repos->fs;
    my %paths_changed = %{$fs->revision_root($fs->youngest_rev)->paths_changed};

    my @path_changes  = map {
        SVN::Simple::Path_Change->new(
            path       => $_,
            svn_change => $paths_changed{$_},
    ) } keys %paths_changed;
