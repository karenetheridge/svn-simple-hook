=head1 NAME

SVN::Simple::Hook - Simple Moose/Mouse-based framework for Subversion hooks

=head1 VERSION

version 0.310

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a collection of roles for L<Moose|Moose::Role> and L<Mouse|Mouse::Role>
that help you implement Subversion repository hooks by providing simple
attribute access to relevant parts of the Subversion API.
This is a work in progress and the interface is extremely unstable at the
moment.  You have been warned!

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 repos_path

L<Directory|Path::Class::Dir> containing the Subversion repository.

=head2 repository

Subversion L<repository object|SVN::Repos>.  Opened on first
call to the accessor.

=head2 author

Author of the current revision or transaction.  Role consumers must provide a
C<_build_author> method to set a default value.

=head2 root

L<Subversion root object|SVN::Fs/_p_svn_fs_root_t> from the repository.  Role
consumers must provide a C<_build_root> method to set a default value.

=head2 paths_changed

A hash reference where the keys are paths in the L</root> and values are
L<SVN::Simple::Path_Change|SVN::Simple::Path_Change> objects.  Enables hooks
to access the changes that triggered them.

=for test_synopsis 1;

=head1 SEE ALSO

See L<SVN::Simple::Hook::PreCommit|SVN::Simple::Hook::PreCommit/SYNOPSIS> for
an example.  This role exists solely to be composed into other roles.
